## The Core Philosophy

The goal of this seminar is **Socratic Inquiry**. We are here to explore ideas, not to reach a consensus, solve a policy problem, or "win" a debate.

* **No Lecturing:** The format is entirely conversational. No one delivers a lecture.
* **Text-Based:** The conversation is grounded strictly in the assigned readings. Participants are expected to reference specific pages to support their points.
* **Equality of Voice:** There is no hierarchy in the seminar room. A junior student has the same standing as a senior professional.

## The Queue System

To ensure fairness and continuity, we utilize a dual-queue system managed by the Discussion Leader.

::: {.callout-note title="The Two Signals"}
There are two distinct ways to enter the conversation. Please use the correct hand signal.
:::

### 1. The Long Queue (New Points)
* **Purpose:** To introduce a new topic, a new angle on the text, or a substantial argument that changes the direction.
* **Signal:** ✋ **Raise your hand**.
* **Priority:** *Standard.* You will be placed in the line and called upon when the current thread is exhausted.

### 2. The Short Queue (Direct Responses)
* **Purpose:** To make a brief rebuttal, a clarification, or a direct follow-up to the *current* speaker. It is **not** for introducing new ideas.
* **Signal:** ☝️ **Raise one finger** (or "Pinch").
* **Priority:** *High.* You are allowed to "jump" the line to keep the conversation fluid and coherent.

> **Warning:** The Discussion Leader has the right to cut off a "Short Point" if it evolves into a lengthy monologue and place that person at the back of the Long Queue.

## Roles & Responsibilities

### The Discussion Leader
The Leader is a facilitator, not a teacher. They will not lecture on the material.
* **Traffic Control:** Their primary job is to manage the queue and recognize speakers.
* **Guardian of the Text:** They will intervene if the discussion drifts into anecdotes unrelated to the readings.
* **Timekeeper:** They ensure the session starts and ends exactly on time.

### The Participants
* **Preparation:** You must read the material in advance.
* **Civility:** Interrupting is strictly forbidden. Wait for the Leader to call on you.
* **Active Listening:** If your point is made by someone else while you are waiting, please lower your hand to save time.

## Logistics

| Feature | Rule |
|:---|:---|
| **The Table** | Seating is arranged in a circle or hollow square so everyone can see everyone else. |
| **Citations** | Always cite the page number or paragraph when making a claim about the text. |
| **Timing** | Sessions end promptly. If a sentence is unfinished when time is called, the session ends regardless. |
| **Crosstalk** | Side conversations and whispering are discouraged; they detract from the shared inquiry. |

### Summary Checklist
1.  Read the text thoroughly.
2.  Cite page numbers.

4.  Address the group, not just the leader.
