1. **Option Market-Making** 

This project follows the **Figlewski JF (1989) reading. We will simulate the dynamic replication strategy for call/put options. The purpose of this project is to understand option theory from a "production" perspective. We will encounter Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques (most importantly the so-called control variate method). This project will highlight the fundamental difference between the risk-neutral approach of neoclassical finance and the decision making under uncertainty approach of Bruno de Finetti as a part of ***Computational Statistical Catallactics.***  


2. **Simulating Stablecoins** 

Stablecoins are a relatively new type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset or currency (typically a fiat currency like USD). The stablecoin maintains its peg through a dual-sided arbitrage process. We will gather historical data on the three most popular stablecoins (USDT, USDC, and DAI) and use proper scoring functions to rank the different "stability" algorithms. You will gain a deep and fundamental understanding of an emerging payments technology that is very likely to become mainstream during 2026. 


3. **Michael Saylor's Master (MSTR) Strategy**

Strategy (MSTR) is the most famous example of a fairly new type of publically traded company: the **digital asset treasury** company. This is a company with an operating balance sheet whose stock trades on a public market (ex: Nasdaq) and who issues securities (common stock, preferred stock, convertibles, and bonds) to purchase digital assets such as Bitcoin. MSTR is believed by some to be, if not technically a Ponzi scheme, at least a Ponzi scheme adjacent company. Focus will be on the common shares (MSTR) and the very innovative adjustable rate montly perpetual preferred stock (STRC). One way to understand what STRC does (or at least attempts to do) is to act like a USD stablecoin pegged at $100 that trades on Nasdaq. Critics claim that it is Ponzi scheme adjacent because the very high dividend payments can only be paid by the issuance of new shares because Bitcoin does not inherently produce cash flows like an operating business is supposed to. At the end of the day, this is an empirical question. We will sort it out! 


4. **BitBonds** 

Dr. Andrew Hohns has proposed the very innovative concept of the BitBond to solve the US debt crisis. A BitBond is a treasury bond that fuses Bitcoin into the bond package. It can offer lower rates of coupon or yield due to the inclusion of the Bitcoin (at least in expectation). Let's say $100 of bond is issued. $90 of the bond will be used to fund government spending (or more likely interest on the debt itself) and $10 will be used to purchase Bitcoin. It is hoped that the expected appreciation of the Bitcoin component will be able to defease the debt. This is a very innovative proposal. In simulating these mechanics we will know how to optimize the design of BitBonds (and similar structured products). The students will also learn the fundamentals of bond valuation as well as the historical performance of Bitcoin from a statistical perspective.
